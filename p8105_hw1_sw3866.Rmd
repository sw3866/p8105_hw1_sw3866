```{r}
#Load the library
library(moderndive)
library(tidyverse)
#Load the dataset
data("early_january_weather")
#Accessing data
help("early_january_weather")
```
This dataset contains hourly meterological data for LGA,JFK and EWR in early January 2013. In total, it has 15 variables including origin, year, month, day, hour, temp, dewp,humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib and time_hour. The size of this dataset is `r nrow(early_january_weather)` rows and `r ncol(early_january_weather)` columns.The mean temperature of this dataset is `r mean (early_january_weather $ temp)` Â°F.
```{r}
ggplot(early_january_weather,aes(x=time_hour,y=temp,color = humid))+geom_point()
ggsave("scatterplot.pdf")
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
